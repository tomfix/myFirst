# myFirst
Just start learning...

Its finally time for me to really learn a programming language. I have started with Ruby and done tons of tutorials. I even made a breakout game in ruby. Nice!. But I feel like Im missing something.. like a learning project or something that is actually usefull.

I have done a larger project in PHP / mySQL back in the old days. Maybe I go for Ruby on Rails and make me a website that I can use. Who know. 

Next up is teaching myself C++. This is for the big boys? Or maybe not. If anyone actually read this and have a tip, please let me know. 

Well, back to work on the gitHub introduction.
